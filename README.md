# Detecting-ddos-Attacks-using-Machine-Learning

These programs are part of my Thesis: Detecting Distributed Denial of Service Attacks using Machine Learning Algorithms.

The algorithms I have tested so far are: Random Forest, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbour (K=3 and K=5), Logistic Regression.
I am still experimenting with other ones like Hist Gradient Boosting.
All of the above algoritmhs are being tested with and without cross validation.

I am using the python library scikit-learn.
In addition to the main library scikit-learn, to run the programs you will need the libraries: pandas, matplotlib, time.
